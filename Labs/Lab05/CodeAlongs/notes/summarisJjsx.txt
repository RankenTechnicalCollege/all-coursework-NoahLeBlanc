jsx allows html and js to be combined 
jsx follows xml rules

xml rules:
	all elements must have one parent, no orphans
	every opening tag must have a closer

browsers do not natibely support jsx
	jsx must be converted to html and js through the build process
	several tools exist for managing this process including vite, webpack and snowpack
.tsx file extension is used for files that contain both ts and jsx
