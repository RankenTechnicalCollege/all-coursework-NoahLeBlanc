State:
	state can hold any kind of js value, including objects.
	they are similar to variables. you store your data here.
	you should always treat state as read only
	when you as a user edit a webpage, you can keep or lose the state on refresh.

	when you want to update an object, create a new one first, then reassign it.

	useState is a function that allows you to create state and work with it.

Props:
	short for properties and they are used to pass data between react componenets.
	React's data flow between componenets is uni-directional(from paren tot child)
	
	if you want to send your state, from parent down to the children.
	then you must prop drill, down to the child you wnat ot interact with.
