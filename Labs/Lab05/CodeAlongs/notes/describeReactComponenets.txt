React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called componenets.
create your own react componenets like thumnail, likeButton, and video.
then comvine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.

before the newer versions the componenets were made out of js classes
but now they are js functions

use can ofc use them conditionally, 
react is programming
