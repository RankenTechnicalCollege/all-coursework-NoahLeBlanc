react dev is based on reuasable modulur componenets 
componenets are reuasble blocks containing both UI and logic
this can be used on the frontend, because react is only for frontend
while the backend is for stuff like node, mongo,express ect

it's sorta like clases in c# or Java

react has only been around for 	12 years
